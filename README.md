# Project Guess Who

I have developed an interactive board game called "Guess Who" for this week's project. The game involves players asking questions to narrow down a particular character, and they can make a guess at each step 

## The problem
To start the project, I spent time analyzing other people's code and learning from their approaches. I used various resources, including materials from Technigo, attended live sessions with Daniel, and relied on Google, StackOverflow, and Slack for support. During coding sessions, I collaborated with my team members. If I had more time, I would have altered all the characters in the game.
