# Project Guess Who

With this weeks project I have designed a guess who game. It is an interactive board game that makes possible for player to ask questions. And based on that questions player has a chance to ask more questions and make a guess at every step of the game. 

## The problem

I have spend some time looking into other people code and tried to understand their approach. This has given me confidence with starting coding guess who project. I have used all the materials provided by Technigo. Attended live sessions with Daniel. Aswell as a lot of googling, StackOverflow and asking in the slack. I have spend coding sessions with my teammates. If I had more time I would have changed all the characters.
